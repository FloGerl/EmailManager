First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

1. **Enhancements:** Suggest a feature, report bugs, or comment on the project's design or architecture.

2. **Writing:** Contribute to documentation or write some tutorials or blog posts.

3. **Code:** Contribute code via pull requests.

4. **Review:** Review and comment on issues or pull requests.

## Process

1. **Fork the Project**

   Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

2. **Create a Branch**

   It's always a good idea to make changes on a separate branch (not on `master`), so create a branch based on `master` and switch to it.

3. **Make Changes**

   Make the necessary changes, ensuring you adhere to the project's coding style and guidelines.

4. **Commit Your Changes**

   Make sure git knows of your changes by adding the changes to the git staging area and then committing them.

5. **Push Your Changes**

   Push your changes to your repository on GitHub.

6. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to your fork on GitHub and then follow the GitHub UI to create a new pull request.

Please ensure that your code passes all tests and, if possible, add new tests for your changes.

## License
